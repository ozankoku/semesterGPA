# Semester GPA Calculator
This repository contains code for a basic semester GPA calculator written in C. The code was initially created as a homework assignment for computer science class. However, I have since improved upon it based on what I've learned in class and additional resources.

# Improvements
Refactored code for readability and efficiency.
Added error handling for invalid input.
Implemented a more robust calculation algorithm.
Utilized best practices learned from class resources and sometimes online resources.

# Usage
To use the semester GPA calculator, simply run the semesterGPA v4. Follow the prompts to input your grades and percentages for each grade, and the program will calculate your GPA for the semester.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank our professor Mr. Serkan for providing the initial assignment that inspired this project and for the valuable lessons learned in class. Additionally, I am grateful to the online resources and tutorials that helped me further develop my programming skills.

# Feedback
Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcome. If you have any questions or comments about the code, feel free to contact me.
